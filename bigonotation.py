Big - O notation
Notates the complexity of algorithms:
    big omega
    big theta
    big O
We usually focus on big O as it's the worst case.

big o notation is a math notation that describes the limiting behavior as the function approaches infinity

Proof Big 



O(1) - constant complexity
    No matter what our input is, our calculations are constant.
O(logn) - logarithmic complexity
    Most cases use log_2, and is when a set is continuously divided by *Really ipmportant*
        Msut be sorted. Divide by two and see where it can't exist.
O(n) - linear complexity
    Directly proportional
O(nlogn) - liearithnmic complexiy
    Combinaition of log_n with n, like Merge sort.
O9(n^2) - quadratic cokplexity
    proportional to the square size of the input, e.g. bubble, insertion, selection sort.
