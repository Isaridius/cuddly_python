What is an algorithm?
    Definition: a sequence of instructions that one msut perform in order to solve a well formulated problem.
    Example: Travel from home to school.

    "A problem well-defined is a problem half-solved." - Charles Kettering (GM Research)

    Reasons:
        Most computer scientists study, research and develop algorithsm t:
        1. Find faster ways to complete a task
        2. Find a more space efficient way to complete a task (memory)
        3. Mathematically formalize solutions for classification/ranking
        4. Given the worst possible constraints, determine if thepr0oblem is the solvable

    Algorithm is similar to recipes
        Similar to recipes, different authors will create a same dish in different methods.
        Computer scientists needs validation of one being better than the other though.

What is Refactoring?
    Definition: Code refactoring is the process of restructing existing code [to improve it] without changing it's input or output.

Greedy Solution: Try the easiest
Brute Force Solution: Try the hardest, most foolproof comprehensive and holistic solutions.
